### Family Life
<hr />

I have an amazing wife, to whom I've been married to for 23 years.  I got married and had my first kid by the time I was 21.  By the grace of God, my family is still here and ready for anything.  
In that 23 years there have been **8** moves, **1** Master’s degree (my wife, not me), **2** Bachelors degrees (both of us) and **3** ***successfully*** homeschooled kiddos (mainly her, but I did something, I'm sure of it).

In the realm of Information Security, my name is n0hats, and I’ve spent over 15 years honing my expertise in Cyber Forensics, Penetration Testing, Security Engineering, and Cyber Assessments. My journey reflects a steadfast commitment to fortifying digital landscapes, leveraging a diverse skill set to tackle complex challenges.  

My story began more than a decade ago, marked by constant growth and hands-on experience. Proficient in both offensive and defensive Penetration Testing, I skillfully utilize tools such as Nmap, Metasploit Framework, Burp Suite Pro, PowerShell Empire, and more to uncover vulnerabilities and strengthen defenses.  

Engaging with platforms like Hack the Box and TryHackMe, I stay at the cutting edge of technology, continuously expanding my skillset. My dedication to ongoing learning has also led to notable achievements, such as automating processes, creating impactful security solutions, and mentoring others in the field.  

A significant facet of my career centers around content creation and community contribution. At DEVO Technology, Inc., I played a key role in elevating security awareness by combining research, automation, and tool development to enhance team capabilities. I automated the creation of over 100 security playbooks by converting lesser-known SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) rules into a unified format, reducing manual processes from weeks to days.  

One of my proudest achievements was developing a Flask-based Python application that streamlined alert creation, automating input processes and outputting JSON files for ingestion into DEVO. My work with atomic red team PowerShell tests further ensured high-quality detection content for customers. Collaborating with stakeholders, I prioritized tasks and delivered critical security solutions on time.  

My influence extends beyond content creation. At Syntasa Corporation, I bolstered security postures and simplified technical intricacies for non-technical stakeholders. At Ingenium Consulting, LLC, I architected enterprise-wide container solutions, mentored junior members, and presented robust solutions to senior leadership. At BAE Systems, I automated forensic report generation for senior leadership, contributing to high-stakes briefings, including reports used by the President of the United States.  

As a holder of a Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology from George Mason University, my curiosity fuels continuous learning. I am proficient in Python, Bash, Ruby on Rails, and other languages, ensuring my toolkit remains dynamic and ready to tackle emerging challenges.  

Join me on my blog as I share insights, experiences, and champion the cause of fortifying digital domains. Together, let’s embark on a journey exploring the evolving landscape of Information Security, where each challenge is an opportunity and each solution a stride toward a safer digital world.
