### Family Life
<hr />

I have an amazing wife, to whom I've been married to for 23 years.  I got married and had my first kid by the time I was 21.  By the grace of God, my family is still here and ready for anything.  
In that 23 years there have been **8** moves, **1** Masterâ€™s degree (my wife, not me), **2** Bachelors degrees (both of us) and **3** ***successfully*** homeschooled kiddos (mainly her, but I did something, I'm sure of it).


### Work Life
<hr />
[My resume](../assets/resume/Joshua Smith - Resume.pdf)
<hr />
In the realm of **Information Security**, my name is **n0hats**, and I've spent over a decade honing my expertise in Cyber Forensics, Penetration Testing, Security Engineering, and Cyber Assessments. My journey reflects a steadfast commitment to fortifying digital landscapes.

My story began more than ten years ago, a journey marked by constant growth. Proficient in both offensive and defensive Penetration Testing, I skillfully utilize tools such as Nmap, Metasploit Framework, Burp Suite Pro, and PowerShell Empire to uncover vulnerabilities.

Engaging with platforms like Hack the Box and TryHackMe, I'm perpetually expanding my skillset. Through hands-on learning, I ensure my expertise stays at the cutting edge.

A significant facet of my career centers around content creation and community contribution. As a Security Content Engineer at DEVO Technology, Inc., I have helped provide awareness and instruction in order to elevate security awareness. I've seamlessly combined research, automation, and tool development, enhancing the team's capabilities. I automated the creation of security alerts by identifying exploits, gathering logs, and generating SIEM alert content.

In this role, I developed a Flask-based Python application that streamlined alert creation, automating input processes and outputting JSON files for ingestion into DEVO. I have worked tirelessly with the [atomic red team powershell tests](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team) in order to create the best possible content for our customers. Collaborating with stakeholders, I prioritized tasks, ensuring timely delivery of critical security products. My commitment extended beyond the team, as I shared insights at KubeCon 2022, augmenting analyst capabilities in the security research domain.

My influence isn't limited to content creation. At Syntasa Corporation, I bolstered security postures and bridged technical intricacies for non-technical stakeholders. At Ingenium Consulting, LLC, I architected enterprise-wide container solutions, mentoring junior members and presenting robust solutions to senior leadership.

A holder of a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology from George Mason University, my curiosity fuels continuous learning. Proficient in Python, Bash, Ruby on Rails, and more, my toolkit remains dynamic, poised to tackle emerging challenges.

Join me on my blog as I share insights, experiences, and champion the cause of fortifying digital domains. Together, let's embark on a journey exploring the evolving landscape of Information Security, where each challenge is an opportunity and each solution a stride towards a safer digital world.
