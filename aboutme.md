### Family Life

I have an amazing wife, to whom I've been married to for 23 years.  I got married and had my first kid by the time I was 21.  By the grace of God, my family is still here and ready for anything.  In that 23 years there have been **8** moves, **1** Masters degree, **2** Bachelors degrees and **3** ***successfully*** homeschooled kiddos.


### Work Life

I have spent most of my career in the [Intelligence Community](https://www.cia.gov).  I recently changed tracks by leaving the IC, moving out to TX and starting a job with [Devo](https://devo.com).  

Some of the highlights from my career include but aren't limited to:

- Planning and running sophisticated offensive technical cyber operations
- Reverse Engineered a couple binaries using [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) and [IDA Pro](https://hex-rays.com/ida-pro/)
- Conducted multiple penetration tests both internally and externally
- Forensics on various types of media
- Created content for the Devo SIEM

and many other things you can find in my [resume](../assets/resume/Joshua Smith - Resume.pdf).
