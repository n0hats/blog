# LLM's

I may make this a blog post but this technology is very interesting.  Imagine for a second if we could just tell our PC's what we want and they do it!  That would be **AMAZING**, but, just like TnT there will always be consequences.  There will **ALWAYS** be bad people that spoil this for everyone.  I started a Discord server called [LLM](https://discord.gg/dH9EN4QC) and welcome anyone and everyone to join.  It's just a shell of a server that I haven't put much thought into yet.  Maybe that's when I turn this into a blog post?  Things to think about....

# Log Standardization
We, as members of the security industry should at least figure out a standard way of sending logs.  I get why we can't standardize all logs (field mismatch for starters) but why can't we have all logs formatted as JSON??  #justathought
