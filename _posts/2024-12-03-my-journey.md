# A Year of Resilience, Growth, and Exciting Future Opportunities

This year has been full of unexpected turns, and for the first time in my career, I faced the challenge of finding stable work. While consulting has kept me engaged, Iâ€™ve been actively seeking something more reliable and fulfilling. But in the midst of this journey, I've been able to achieve some incredible milestones that have fueled my passion for growth.

### ðŸš­ Kicked a 29-Year Smoking Habit
One of my most significant achievements this year was quitting smoking cold turkey. After 29 years of smoking, I finished my last pack of Marlboro Lights in January and never looked back. No substitutes, no replacementsâ€”just done. This win was huge for me, as it marks a personal victory in commitment and perseverance.

### ðŸ’¼ Interviewed with Prestigious Organizations
Although I havenâ€™t landed the role yet, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to interview with some highly respected organizations. Making it to the final round and being considered a strong contender is something Iâ€™m incredibly proud of. These experiences have reinforced my belief that I am capable of so much more, and Iâ€™m excited to continue pursuing roles that align with my goals.

### ðŸ§  Focused on Mental Health
This has been a period of self-reflection, and Iâ€™m proud of the strides Iâ€™ve made in managing my mental health. Itâ€™s been an ongoing process, but Iâ€™ve learned valuable lessons in resilience and self-care. I know that mental health is just as important as technical expertise, and itâ€™s something Iâ€™ll continue to nurture as I move forward.

### ðŸ¥¤ Cut Soda Intake to Almost Zero
Anyone who knows me knows how deeply embedded my love for Coke was, but Iâ€™m proud to say Iâ€™ve cut my soda intake down to almost zero. Small changes like this may seem insignificant to some, but they represent a shift toward a healthier lifestyle that complements my personal and professional growth.

### ðŸ’» Learned React and Built a Web App
On the professional side, I challenged myself to learn React and built a web app. Itâ€™s still in testing, but Iâ€™m excited to share it soon. The process of learning something new, creating something tangible, and diving into web development has been an incredibly rewarding experience. It also gave me the confidence to know that I can master new technologies, which only strengthens my adaptability in this fast-paced tech world.

### Growing Through Challenges: A Strong Desire to Learn
Throughout this year, Iâ€™ve also been constantly motivated by the desire to learn and grow. With my passion for tech and security, Iâ€™ve always believed in the value of staying curious. Whether Iâ€™m mastering a new coding language, diving into complex security concepts, or collaborating with others in different fields, Iâ€™m always looking for ways to push my boundaries and expand my skills.

The setbacks Iâ€™ve encountered have only fueled this drive. Every challenge has made me more determined to not just learn but thrive. Iâ€™ve actively sought out opportunities to enhance my knowledge in areas like threat hunting, incident response, and security tools. As I continue to learn, Iâ€™m always excited about how these skills can be applied to new challenges.

### Looking Ahead: Embracing New Opportunities
Through all of thisâ€”job hunting, consulting, and supporting my familyâ€”Iâ€™ve learned that resilience is key. While things havenâ€™t always been easy, Iâ€™ve proven to myself that I am adaptable, resourceful, and ready for what comes next.

Recently, Iâ€™ve expanded my horizons even further, exploring roles like Sales Engineer. Iâ€™m excited about connecting with people, bridging the gap between technical solutions and human connections, and contributing to projects that drive impactful change. Iâ€™m eager to bring my skills, adaptability, and excitement to new challenges in roles that align with my growing capabilities.

As I continue to learn and grow, I know the right opportunity is just around the corner. If you're hiring and looking for someone driven, resilient, and ready to make a meaningful impact, Iâ€™d love to connect. I'm looking forward to the next big opportunity and can't wait to see where this journey takes me.
